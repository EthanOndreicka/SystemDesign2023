    <h1>"3 button designs from 3 different decades that almost results in catastrophe"<br>Summary</h1>
    <h4>By Ethan Ondreicka</h4>

    <p>"3 button designs from 3 different decades that almost results in catastrophe" written by Pulkit 
        Verma, is an article about how major problems occured due to simple design flaws in buttons. Whether 
        it be placement, or what the button represented; all of these examples show that when designing, everything, 
        no matter how small, should be meticulously created. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The first button example comes from Pennsylvania in 1979. The buttons in a U.S. commerical nuclear power plant 
        were confusing, which caused huge usabilty problems. When the nuclear accident began, failures happened within 
        a non-nuclear secondary system but was worsened due to a valve being stuck open. Operators thought the valve 
        was because the status light indicated otherwise, but it turned out that the button had nothing to do with the 
        valve; the light was only on because that was the indication that it was powered. If the nuclear operators knew 
        exactly what each button did, they could've stopped major damage before it occured.
    </p>

        The second button design example comes from Palm Beach County, Florida, in the year 2000. The electronic voting 
        system used a vote counting system called the "butterfly ballot". This ballot was poorly designed and led to mass 
        confusion which caused a large number of voters to mismark their ballots. The layout of the buttons caused voters 
        to vote for Reform Party candidate, Pat Buchanan, when they intended to vote for Al Gore from the Democratic Party 
        instead. In the end, the votes were recounted and Bush still won regardless, but the whole voting process led to calls 
        for electoral reform in Florida.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last button design comes from Lincoln cars in 2015. The location of the engine start/stop button was placed directly 
        below the "sport" mode button. This caused drivers to turn off their cars while driving at high speeds, instead of switching 
        to sport mode due to their limited attention to which button they were pressing. Lincoln ended up recalling all 13,574 cars 
        produced and moved the engine start/stop button at the very opposite end of the column to lower the chances of drivers stopping 
        their engine while driving.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the end, it's important to understand that bad design can lead to catasrophes. Something as small as button position can lead 
        to people being harmed in very serious ways. When designing something, all parts, no matter how small, should be carefully thought 
        out and considered.
