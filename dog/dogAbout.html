    <h2><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_raccoon_dog' target="_blank">What are the Raccoon Dogs About?</a></h2>
    <p>The common raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides), also called the Chinese or Asian raccoon dog, or the namold is a small, 
        heavy-set, fox-like canid native to East Asia. Named for its raccoon-like face markings, it is most closely related to foxes.
        Common raccoon dogs feed on many animals and plant matter, and are unusual among canids (dogs, foxes, and other members of the family Canidae) for 
        climbing trees and for hibernating in cold winters. They are widespread in their native range, and are invasive in Europe where they were introduced 
        for the fur trade. The similar Japanese raccoon dog (Nyctereutes viverrinus), native to Japan, is the only other living member of the genus Nyctereutes.
        [2] Other names for the common raccoon dog include mangut (its Evenki name),[3] neoguri (its Korean name) or simply raccoon dog.
