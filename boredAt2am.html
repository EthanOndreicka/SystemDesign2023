    <h1>Bair Blogs</h1>
    <p>This is my first Bair Blog. All I do is type about random things I may or may not be interested in, I don't really know. Each post
        has It's own unique topic. Also, I would not be surprised if there are any gramatical mistakes in these... VSCode doesn't have any
        spell check for this stuff... But lets begin with our topic of discussion
    </p>
    <br>

    <p>Let's talk about Mesopotamia! I don't know much about Mesopotamia, all I really know is that it was the first ever civilization and that
        it was in between the tigris and euphrates river. So let us do some research and then I will provide some great commentary on how I feel
        or think about each thing I learn!

        So doing some quick research, I remembered hearing something about the Indus River Valley in school and honestly thought Mesopotamia was
        the same thing for some reason. After looking it up, It's clearly not (lol). Not sure how the whole BC, C, BCE, AD situation works, but all I know
        is that Mesopotamia started in 3100 BC and the Indus River Valley civilization started in 3300 C, which is IDK how long after Meso. I also want  
        to point out that I think It's strange that the people from Mesopotamia are called Sumerians instead of Mesopotamians, but I suppose that's a
        blog for another day...

        So I have done some more research and it turns out the civilization was called Sumer and they lived on the land called Mesopotamia. Now I'm even more confused
        on this whole history thing. Also unrelated, but I have now just realized why words like "I've", "It's", etc. all have the capital I... It's because the word
        is a conjunction of I and whatever else and I is always capital... my brain is exploring new heights as we speak. I think I should write a novel at some point
        because I'm honestly a very intersting writer. I would probably ramble about random things like I'm doing right now, but I think that's just part of the experience.

        But with that said, I think this blog ends here... It's getting quite late and I still need to shower. Next blog I write will be on conspiracy theories and instead
        of doing research to debunk them, I will try to debunk them myself and then end up believing in them because I can't figure it out... also I am giving my right hand
        carpel tunnel typing all of this. I am not in the best position (posture wise) to be typing... anyway, I hope you enjoyed, and goodbye my friends and foes.
