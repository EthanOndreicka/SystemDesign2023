         <li>What is the 'double diamond' approach? What are the four phases and a short description of each phase?</li>
         <p>The 'double diamond' approach is a design approach created by The Design Council of the United Kingdom. The four phases are as follows, Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver. 
            Discover means to gather insights about a specific problem. Define is to develop a clear brief that frames the design challenge. Develop is to create, prototype, and test solutions. 
            Deliver is the final project that has been made and launched.

         <li>What are Dan Saffer's four approaches to interaction design - and a short description of each?  Which approach suits your software development style best?</li>
         <p>Dan Saffer's four approaches to interaction design are a User-centered design, Activity-centered design, Systems design, and a Genius design. A User-centered design is one where the user 
            knows best and is the guide to the designer. In a Activity-centered design, there's more focus on the behavior surrounding particular tasks. A System's design is a structured, rigorous, and 
            holistic design that focuses on context and is appropriate for complex problems. Finally, a Genius design is one that is focused completely on the experience and creative flair of the designer.

         <li>What is "cooperative design" and how does it fit in with what you know about Agile?</li>
         <p>Cooperative design is a design philosophy that places those for whom systems, technologies, and services are being designed, as central actors in creation activities. 
            This fits in with Agile because you communicate with your client for design specifications.

         <li>What are Gould & Lewis's three key principles of HCI.</li>
         <p>Gould & Lewis's three key principles of HCI are Early focus on users and tasks, Empirical measurement, and Iterative design.</p>
         <li>What are the four basic activities of interaction design?</li>
         <p>The four basic activities of interaction design are Discovering requirements for the interactive product, Designing alternatives that meet those requirements, Prototyping the alternative 
            design so that they can be communicated and assessed, and Evaluating the product and the user experience it offers throughout the process.

         <p>
            - No clear way to measure effects of involving users in development but a review concluded that user involvement has a positive effect on user satisfaction and system use.<br>
            - For new products, developer satisfaction increased as user participation did.<br>
            - As user participation increased, satisfaction decreased<br>
            - Product and type of involvement all had impact on effectiveness of user input<br>
            - "User involvement is undoubtedly beneficial, but the levels and types of involvement require careful consideration and balance.
