            <td>When using an ebook opposed to a paperback book, there are many differences but also many ways an ebook tries to simulate the book experience. 
                When using an ebook, while turning a page it plays an animation like a real book would. The ebook background is also textured in a way to make it 
                look like a real book. It does differ in the way that you can't write or highlight anything in the book. However, the pros outweigh the cons as you can have a whole 
                library of books on one device you can carry around everywhere. As for paper-based maps vs smartphone map apps, the apps use the same design scheme as a paper map to provide 
                users with familiarity. Application based maps provide a much better experience as they can provide in-depth directions to anywhere in the matter of seconds, as well as change directions based on 
                current traffic/accidents from miles away.
